## Sign-Language-Translator

Sign language is a fundamental method of communication for those with impaired hearing. However, it may be difficult for those who do not know sign language to communicate or understand those who are limited only to sign language as a form of communication.

This goal of this project is to prototype a solution to facilitate ease of communication with those with impaired hearing. This web application applies machine learning with TensorFlow to take sign language inputted by users and predict the translation.

# About Thie Project
* This project is a work in progress!
* User-inputted images of (American) sign language are taken in and the applicatioin returns the output translated by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
* The CNN used is written and trained in TensorFlow based on American Sign Language (dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/asl-dataset)


# This Site Uses:
* Vue.js frontend
  * Bootstrap - Vue
* Flask backend
* TensorFlow machine learning models


# Future Implementation:
* Create and train model based on videos to translate whole words or sentences
